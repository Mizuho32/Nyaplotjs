Nyaplotjs is a back-end library for [Nyaplot](https://github.com/domitry/nyaplot). Its goal is to allow Ruby and other language users to create interactive plots in their favorite styles. Nyaplotjs provides useful interface to generate plots based on JSON object.

This software has been developed as a product in Google Summer of Code 2014 (GSoC2014). Please visit a website of [SciRuby project](http://sciruby.com/blog/) to see the progress of this project.

Nyaplotjs and Nyaplot will be merged into one library before the end of GSoC 2014 term.
