Nyaplotjs is a rich plotting library built on the top of d3.js.
Its goal is to provide the useful JSON interface for plotting to other programming languages including Ruby and Python.

Nyaplotjs is originally developed as a back-end library for Nyaplot, a visualization library written in Ruby.
A simple JavaScript interface was added in v2 and Python wrapper is now being developed.
